# Galaga Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic arcade game Galaga in Java. The game features a player-controlled spaceship that can move left and right, shoot lasers, and destroy enemy spaceships. The enemy spaceships are organized into several waves, with each wave becoming more difficult than the last. The game is over when the player loses all of their lives or destroys all enemy spaceships.
